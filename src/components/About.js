                    Hello Humans!
                    My name is Ujjawal (you can call me usual) or better let's go with my anglicized name Ujay. I am a Full-stack Developer who reinvented his career, jumping from a 6-year career in Civil Engineering/Facility Management into the wild wild world of coding. I love working with PERN/MERN stack. My favourite scripting language is JS, but I can also code in Ruby, Python and TS if I have to, woot woot.
                    <br />
                    Apart from coding and making real-life projects, I love to run, bike, yoga (cliche huh), netflixing(if that's even a word).
                    <br />
                    I am a coffee connoisseur who likes to explore different coffee joints and do extended coding sessions under the influence of caffeine.
